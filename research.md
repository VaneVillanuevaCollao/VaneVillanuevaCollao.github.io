* **Data Governance Firms in Corporate Boardroomss**

  <summary><span class='icon-right'></span> Abstract</summary><p>-->
In this paper, I plan to argue that algorithms should be integrated into the board structure of data-driven enterprises because of the unmanageable volumes of data they generate. Thus, data governance frameworks are crucial for management but especially for board decision-making. How to include data governance in the boardroom? This article illustrates how data governance can be implemented in the boardroom by creating a hybrid model: an “algorithm” next to the human board composition. This boardroom model includes a legal entity (a Data Governance Firm—DGF) for designing an algorithmic board member consistent with the corporation’s purpose. The DGF’s role in developing an algorithmic seat is to transform the corporation and its constituencies into complex intersectional relationships based on data. Therefore, rather than being a nexus of contracts, modern corporations and their constituencies can be included in datasets showing a nexus of data.

* **The New Frontier of Data Privacy and Ownership Structure: Tokenizing Genomics**

  <summary><span class='icon-right'></span> Abstract</summary><p>-->
Biotech companies have resorted to blockchain and unregulated vehicles, such as initial coin offerings, as a cheap way of monetizing DNA while funding the company. This paper explains how biotech blockchain companies have promised investors control over genetic data but obscured other dynamics within the company ownership structure. Not only do token holders lack voting rights, but they are in a new vulnerable position: the company has possession of their genetic data. At the same time, traditional shareholders surreptitiously gain more power and control. This paper’s analysis will shed light on the relationship between shareholders who invested capital and token holders whose interests depend on the human genetic capital shared with the company and the emerging implications from this scenario..

* **Protecting Privacy with Blockchain: When Genomics Meets DTC, European Journal of Privacy & Technology, forthcoming (2022)**

  <summary><span class='icon-right'></span> Abstract</summary><p>-->
The technology around genomics has moved at a swift pace while reducing the entire sequencing costs. Biotech advancement increased the demand for gene sequencing services and data storage, creating privacy risks and making de-identification difficult. To mitigate those risks, genomic startups have turned to cryptographic technologies like Blockchain. However, Blockchain is not a panacea, and privacy issues in genomics are a concern that is hardly addressed from a bioethical or philosophical perspective. The most challenging obstacle plaintiffs face in privacy lawsuits is assessing the injury–the connection between privacy threats and concrete harms. This paper explains why genomic companies that use Blockchain expose their users to specific harms that fall outside agencies and regulations radars by providing some examples of injuries-in-fact.

	Political parties are the nexus between voters and politicians. Legislative party switching not only distorts the representativeness of electoral results but also threatens the stability of the democratic system by obfuscating the electorate. In order to design policies that restore the representativeness of the political system, it is paramount to understand the determinants behind legislators’ behavior. Using a novel dynamic panel data set, constructed by collecting more than 420,000 votes from Argentina’s House of  Representatives, this paper studies party switching and group dynamics. This work estimates the relevance of individual and party characteristics as well as peers effects, power configuration and the possibility of remaining independent inside the Chamber as key features of legislator’s decision to switch. I find that party switching is an interdependent decision that relies more on same party peer effects than in different party peer effects. Ideological Distance, loyalty to party leaders, power of the party and the legislative cycle are important determinants of party switching. Moreover, increasing reputation costs of party switching is less effective at preventing it than promoting a transparent electoral process. By exploring the motives behind the switch, I find that party switchers have a higher probability of improving their ballot position compared to non switchers, suggesting that office seeking legislators have higher incentives to switch. Additionally, party switchers changed their voting behavior in the period close to their switching meeting, whereas non-switchers’ behavior was not affected by same party switches. Lastly I find that both office seeking and ideology seeking motivations affect the decision of a legislator to switch in their term.</p></details>

	More than 10% of US adults do not have a credit record at one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies (Brevoort, et al 2015). They are considered “credit invisible”. Credit invisibility is more common among minority and rural populations who tend to be more financially vulnerable and may have less access to traditional forms of credit. There is evidence that access to high-speed broadband internet is associated with reduced credit invisibility (Brevoort, et al 2018). The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effects of broadband deployment on financial access and credit invisibility, with special focus on Indian Country. We leverage the roll-out of several programs to expand broadband provision among rural areas and tribal lands that were part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, through several agencies (RUS, NTIA and FCC) to shed light on whether efforts to increase access to broadband also increase access to credit and engagement in financial markets.</p></details>-->

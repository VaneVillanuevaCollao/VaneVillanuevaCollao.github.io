	In the last two decades, the retail sector has experienced several changes: a sharp decline in the number of brick-and-mortar establishments, the entrance of online retailers, and the expansion of e-commerce. In this paper, I use data from County Business Patterns and the Current Population Survey to study the effects of e-commerce as the digital disruption in the retail sector. I exploit the variation in the enactment of state legislation, known as Amazon Tax, to measure the effect of reducing the price advantage of out-of-state online retail on local labor markets. Through an event study difference-in-difference approach, I find robust evidence that the enactment of Amazon tax increases both the ratio of employment to the working-age population as well as establishments to the population at the county level.</p></details>

	In this paper, we use three recently released nationwide data sets to establish the current state of the tribal digital divide. Toward that end, we develop an empirical approach to use geographies such as census block groups and ZCTAs to study the tribal digital inequities by comparing households on tribal land to neighboring households on non-tribal land. We find the tribal digital gap takes several forms. Households on tribal land are less likely to have internet at home and, when internet is available, have slower download and upload speeds on both fixed and mobile devices and more expensive basic broadband plans. We also find that, across many internet-related outcomes, traditional factors that drive the cost of broadband deployment -- low population density, lower incomes and lack of complementary infrastructure -- cannot account for the large differences in tribal broadband.</p></details>

	Political parties are the nexus between voters and politicians. Legislative party switching not only distorts the representativeness of electoral results but also threatens the stability of the democratic system by obfuscating the electorate. In order to design policies that restore the representativeness of the political system, it is paramount to understand the determinants behind legislators’ behavior. Using a novel dynamic panel data set, constructed by collecting more than 420,000 votes from Argentina’s House of  Representatives, this paper studies party switching and group dynamics. This work estimates the relevance of individual and party characteristics as well as peers effects, power configuration and the possibility of remaining independent inside the Chamber as key features of legislator’s decision to switch. I find that party switching is an interdependent decision that relies more on same party peer effects than in different party peer effects. Ideological Distance, loyalty to party leaders, power of the party and the legislative cycle are important determinants of party switching. Moreover, increasing reputation costs of party switching is less effective at preventing it than promoting a transparent electoral process. By exploring the motives behind the switch, I find that party switchers have a higher probability of improving their ballot position compared to non switchers, suggesting that office seeking legislators have higher incentives to switch. Additionally, party switchers changed their voting behavior in the period close to their switching meeting, whereas non-switchers’ behavior was not affected by same party switches. Lastly I find that both office seeking and ideology seeking motivations affect the decision of a legislator to switch in their term.</p></details>

	More than 10% of US adults do not have a credit record at one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies (Brevoort, et al 2015). They are considered “credit invisible”. Credit invisibility is more common among minority and rural populations who tend to be more financially vulnerable and may have less access to traditional forms of credit. There is evidence that access to high-speed broadband internet is associated with reduced credit invisibility (Brevoort, et al 2018). The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effects of broadband deployment on financial access and credit invisibility, with special focus on Indian Country. We leverage the roll-out of several programs to expand broadband provision among rural areas and tribal lands that were part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, through several agencies (RUS, NTIA and FCC) to shed light on whether efforts to increase access to broadband also increase access to credit and engagement in financial markets.</p></details>
